# My Angular Directives

This is a collection of AngularJS directives I usually need in my projects and can't find anywhere. It includes:

- **prepend-http-directive**, which will auto-prepend 'http' to any input field you want when the user starts typing. This seems lame, but the input[type=url] won't validate otherwise.
